                        <h2>Introduction</h2>

                        <p> When two black holes (BHs) interact, they spiral
    towards each other and eventually merge, radiating gravitational waves in
    the process. The end state is a single black hole that is only
    characterized by its mass, angular momentum and linear momentum. Therefore,
    this process can be thought of as a scattering process.
                        </p>

                        <p> Binary black hole scattering is a very complicated
    process that requires numerical simulations to accurately predict the
    outcome. These simulations are very expensive, taking about a month on a
    super computer to run. In recent years, several "surrogate" models for
    these simulations have been developed.  These models are trained against a
    large number of numerical simulations, using some fancy interpolation
    methods. In the end, the surrogate can reproduce the result of the
    simulation as accurately as the simulation itself, but in a fraction of a
    second, and on your laptop, rather than a month on a super computer!
                        </p>

                        <p> In this package, we use these surrogate models to
    visualize the binary black hole scattering process. You can now generate
    visualizations at any point in the parameter space, in a few seconds,
    without needing to do a full numerical simulation! More details about
    binary black holes scattering and how these visualizations are generated
    can be found in our (upcoming) paper arxiv.xxxx.xxxx.

                        <p> Here we see a precessing binary black hole merger.
    The black holes are shown as circular markers, with arrows indicating their
    spins. The orbital angular momentum is indicated by the pink arrow at the
    origin. The colors in the back-planes show the value of the plus
    polarization of the GW as seen by an observer at that location; red means
    positive and blue means negative, notice the quadrupolar pattern of the
    radiation. In the plot at the bottom, we show the plus and cross
    polarizations as seen from the camera viewing angle.
                        </p>
                        <p> Here the BH spins are misaligned w.r.t the angular
    momentum direction. Therefore, the spins, the angular momentum, and the
    orbital plane all precess during the inspiral. It is interesting to see how
    the remnant spin direction is very close to the direction of the orbital
    angular momentum near merger.
                        </p>

                        <p> Here we show the same animation, but with a varying
    camera angle. We project the waveform only on the bottom plane. In the plot
    at the bottom we see how the waveform changes based on the viewing angle;
    this is because the different (spin-weighted spherical harmonic) modes
    combine with different weights based on the observer viewing angle.  Notice
    how the GW signal is strongest along the direction of orbital angular
    momentum and weakest in perpendicular directions.

                        <p> Here the spins are aligned w.r.t the angular
    momentum direction, and there is no precession. Due to symmetries, the
    remnant spin is also aligned, while the remnant velocity is restricted to
    the orbital plane.
                        </p>

                        </video>

                        <p> In this case, notice how the spins line up in a
    single plane close to the merger. This is believed to be necessary to cause
    super-kicks, or very high remnant velocities. Notice how fast the final
    black hole flies away compared to the above cases. </p>

                        </video>

                        <p> The kick velocity is very sensitive to the
    orientation of the component spins near merger. Here we show several cases
    where the spins have a fixed magnitude and are restricted to the orbital
    plane, but the angle between them is varied.  Notice the sinusoidal nature
    of the final kick magnitude.
