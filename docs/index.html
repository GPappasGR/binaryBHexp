                        <h2>Introduction</h2>

                        <p> When two black holes (BHs) interact, they lose
    energy through gravitational waves and spiral towards each other. They
    eventually merge to give rise to a single black hole. The final black hole
    is characterized only by its mass, spin, and velocity (also called recoil
    kick or simply, kick).
                        </p>

                        <p> The merger of binary black holes (BBHs) is a very
    complicated process that requires numerical simulations to accurately
    predict the outcome. These simulations are very expensive, taking about a
    month on a super computer to run. In recent years, several "surrogate"
    models for these simulations have been developed.  These models are trained
    against a large number of numerical simulations, using some fancy
    interpolation methods. In the end, the surrogate can reproduce the result
    of the simulation as accurately as the simulation itself, but in a fraction
    of a second, and on your laptop, rather than a month on a super computer!
                        </p>

                        <p> In this package, we use these surrogate models to
    visualize the evolution of binary black hole systems. You can now generate
    visualizations at any point in the parameter space, in a few seconds,
    without needing to do a full numerical simulation!

                        <p> Here we see a precessing binary black hole merger.
    The black holes are shown as circular markers, with arrows indicating their
    spins. The orbital angular momentum is indicated by the pink arrow at the
    origin. The colors in the back-planes show the value of the plus
    polarization of the GW as seen by an observer at that location; red means
    positive and blue means negative, notice the quadrupolar pattern of the
    radiation. In the plot at the bottom, we show the plus and cross
    polarizations as seen from the camera viewing angle. After the ringdown, we
    speed up the movie to exaggerate the kick.
                        </p>
                        <p> Here the BH spins are misaligned w.r.t the angular
    momentum direction. Therefore, the spins, the angular momentum, and the
    orbital plane all precess during the inspiral. It is interesting to see how
    the remnant spin direction is very close to the direction of the orbital
    angular momentum near merger. This figure corresponds to figure xx of
    arxiv.xxx.xxxx.
                        </p>

                        <p> Here we show the same animation, but with a varying
    camera angle. We project the waveform only on the bottom plane. In the plot
    at the bottom we see how the waveform changes based on the viewing angle;
    this is because the different (spin-weighted spherical harmonic) modes
    combine with different weights based on the observer viewing angle.  Notice
    how the GW signal is strongest along the direction of orbital angular
    momentum and weakest in perpendicular directions. This figure corresponds
    to figure xx of arxiv.xxx.xxxx.

                        <p> Here the spins are aligned w.r.t the angular
    momentum direction, and there is no precession. Due to symmetries, the
    remnant spin is also aligned, while the remnant velocity is restricted to
    the orbital plane.

                        <video width="100%" height="auto"  controls>
                            <source src="movies/hangup.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.
                        </video>

                        <p> Here we demonstrate the "orbital hangup effect". On
    the left is a case where both black hole spins are aligned with the orbital
    angular momentum. On the right is a case where they are anti-aligned. Both
    cases start 4500M from the merger, however, due to the orbital hangup-up
    effect, the aligned-spin case has more orbits to cover before the merger.
    As a result it also loses more energy to gravitational waves, and the final
    mass is smaller. On the other hand, because the anti-aligned spins reduce
    the total orbital angular momentum of the system, the final spin is lesser
    in that case. In these cases, due to the symmetries present, the final kick
    is zero.
                        </p>

                        <p>
    In our visualizations, there are always 30 frames per orbit. Therefore,
    even though the times to merger are the same for both at the start of the
    visualization, the anti-aligned case merges faster in movie-time because
    it has lesser number of orbits to cover.
                        </p>

                        </video>

                        <p> In this case, notice how the spins line up in a
    single plane close to the merger. This is believed to be necessary to cause
    super-kicks, or very high remnant velocities. Notice how fast the final
    black hole flies away compared to the above cases. This figure corresponds
    to figure xx of arxiv.xxx.xxxx.

                        <p> The kick velocity is very sensitive to the
    orientation of the component spins near merger. Here we show several cases
    where the spins have a fixed magnitude and are restricted to the orbital
    plane, but the angle between them is varied.  Notice the sinusoidal nature
    of the final kick magnitude. This figure corresponds to figure xx of
    arxiv.xxx.xxxx.

                        </header>

                        <p> Since this package does not rely directly on
    numerical simulations, you can generate new visualizations yourself, on
    your laptop! These instructions have been tested for MacOS and Linux.

                        <h3>Installation</h3>

                        <p> This package is available on <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/binaryBHexp/">PyPI</a>, and can be installed using pip.
                        </p>

<pre><code>pip install binaryBHexp
</code></pre>

                         <p> You can also get the package from our
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vijayvarma392/binaryBHexp">Github</a> repo as follows. 
                        </p>

<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:vijayvarma392/binaryBHexp.git
cd binaryBHexp
</code></pre> 



                        <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

                        <p> This package relies on the surrogate models, <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/NRSur7dq2"> NRSur7dq2 </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://pypi.org/project/surfinBH"> surfinBH </a>. These are
    automatically installed with the pip installation. For the Github version,
    these can be installed using pip.
                        </p>

<pre><code>pip install NRSur7dq2
pip install surfinBH
</code></pre>

                        <h3>Usage</h3>

                        <p> If you installed the binaryBHexp package with pip,
    it should have added a new shell command called binaryBHexp, which you can
    use as shown below. Instead, if you are using the Github version, the
    script can be found in the repository, and you need to replace binaryBHexp
    with ./binaryBHexp in the following.
                        </p>

<pre><code>binaryBHexp --q 2 --chiA 0.2 0.7 -0.1 --chiB 0.2 0.6 0.1
</code></pre>

                        <p> For more options, do:
                        </p>

<pre><code>binaryBHexp -h
</code></pre>
